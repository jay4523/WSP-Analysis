			<h1>Spring Lake Elementary Site Analysis</h1>
		</header>
		
		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		
		<p>The Spring Lake Elementary website is intended to not only cater toward current students and their parents, but to also enthuse prospective students to join the 		school as well. Although the current website is functional, it can be revitalized in order to maintain workflow and a strong user experience. The navigation should be 		cleaned up by combining certain navigation elements into one. As an example, "Awards and Recognition" could easily be placed within the "About Our School" page. There 		should also be some form of a "CTA" on the home page in order to involve current and/or prospective students. By cleaning up the UI and overall design, this site			could readily obtain a more consistent user. </p>
		
		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
		
		<p>The client-school has an abundance of competition. There are currently 37 competing elementary school websites within the Seminole County Public School system. The 		two closest schools in proximity are Bear Lake Elementary and Altamonte Elementary. Although both schools have more organized content on their respective websites, 		Spring Lake Elementary is gaining more keyword searches from the school name than both competing schools combined. Bear Lake Elementary seems to have many broken 			links which could possibly frustrate the user, causing them to disconnect. However, Bear Elementary has a clever "Parents" tab that focuses on everything a parent 			would need to know. Altamonte Elementary has a website that is left-aligned when and is very displeasing to the eye in terms of position. The navigation has an 			innovative appeal, but the function is very sluggish and the cursor can easily fall off of the menu and cause the user to start from the beginning. In order to gain 		additional registrants for our client, "Awards and Recognition" has proven to be even more useful on a more frequented page such as "Home" or "About Our School".</p>
		
		<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
		
		<h3>Rebecca</h3>

		<p>Rebecca is a 35 years old and is currently researching elementary schools that are close in proximity to her home in Altamonte Springs, Fl. Her son is about to 			complete his term at a nearby pre-school and Rebecca has determined that she had better start her research! Considering Rebecca is a great soft-ball player, she 			places great importance on health. Therefore she seems to enjoy looking up the current lunch schedules for current students at these prospective schools.</p>
		
		<h3>Ally</h3>

		<p>Ally remembers her amazing graduation day after completing high school. Many years have passed since that day and she still regrets never continuing her education. 		She is now 37 years old and wishes for her 6-year old daughter to become more successful than she is. Ally is constantly logging into the Spring Lake Elementary 			website to look for ways that she can help her daughter succeed. Therefore, Ally is always on the PTA and calendar pages to keep up with current events. Ally can't 		wait for her young one to eventually move to high school and then college!</p>
